This is a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount — only if the discount is 20% or higher.
If the discount is less than 20%, the program returns the original price without changes.
It’s designed for easy interaction with the user and displays friendly messages.

Example:

=== Discount Calculator ===
Enter the original price ($): 100
Enter the discount percentage: 25
🎉 You got a 25% discount!
Original price: $100.00
Final price after discount: $75.00


if discount is less than 20%

=== Discount Calculator ===
Enter the original price ($): 80
Enter the discount percentage: 10
ℹ️ Discount less than 20% — no discount applied.
Price remains: $80.00
